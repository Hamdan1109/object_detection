# Object Detection with YOLO

This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time object detection. The model is implemented using the Ultralytics YOLO library along with OpenCV for video capture and image processing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or later
- **pip**: Python package installer

## Libraries Required

You need to install the following libraries:

1. **Ultralytics**: The YOLO model implementation.
   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics
2.OpenCV for image and video processing
pip install opencv-python
cvzone: An easy-to-use library for computer vision tasks (optional).
pip install cvzone
